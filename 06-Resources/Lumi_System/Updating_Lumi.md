# Updating Lumi - Explained Simply

**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026

This guide explains how to get new features and improvements for Lumi, written for people who've never used GitHub or command-line tools before.

---

## The Big Picture: Why Updates Matter

**What are updates?**

Think of Lumi like an app on your phone. Every few weeks, there are improvements:
- New features that make your work easier
- Bugs get fixed
- Things run smoother

The difference: Lumi lives on your computer (not in an app store), so updating works differently.

**What makes Lumi updates safe:**

Your data is **completely separate** from the Lumi application. Updates only touch the application - never your notes, tasks, or projects.

It's like updating Microsoft Word. The app gets better, but your documents stay exactly as they are.

**Your customizations are preserved too:**
- **CLAUDE.md personal notes:** Anything between `USER_EXTENSIONS_START/END` is preserved during updates
- **Custom MCP servers:** Name them with `user-` or `custom-` (e.g., `user-gmail`) so updates always keep them

---

## What You Need to Know First

### You Have Two Versions of Lumi

When you use Lumi, there are actually TWO versions:

1. **Your copy** - Lives on your computer
   - Your notes, tasks, projects
   - Your customizations
   - Your daily work

2. **The main version** - Lives on GitHub
   - New features being added
   - Bug fixes
   - Improvements from other users

**Updating means:** Getting the improvements from the main version and adding them to your copy, without touching your data.

### What is GitHub?

**GitHub is like Dropbox for code.**

Just like Dropbox stores your files in the cloud, GitHub stores Lumi's files. But GitHub has special features that help:
- Track every change made to Lumi
- Let you download improvements
- Keep your version and the main version in sync

**Do you need a GitHub account?**

Not for basic updates! You can:
- ✓ Check for updates (no account needed)
- ✓ Download updates (no account needed)
- ✓ Use all of Lumi (no account needed)

**When you DO need an account:**
- If you want to save your copy of Lumi on GitHub (like a backup)
- If you want to share improvements you make with others
- If you want to report problems

**Creating a GitHub account is free** and takes 2 minutes: [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

But again - **not required for updating Lumi**.

### What is Git?

**Git is the tool that handles updates.**

Think of it like this:
- **GitHub** = The website (like Dropbox.com)
- **Git** = The tool on your computer that talks to GitHub (like the Dropbox app)

**Do you have Git?**

Probably yes! If you followed the setup, you already have it.

To check, you'll type one command later. Don't worry - we'll tell you exactly what to do.

## Updating Lumi: The Simple Way

### Step 1: Run the Update Command

**In Cursor, in the chat where you talk to Lumi, type:**

```
/lumi-update
```

**Press Enter.**

**What happens:**

Lumi connects to GitHub, checks if there's a newer version, and shows you what's available.

You'll see one of two things:

**Option A: You're up to date**
```
✅ You're already on the latest version (v1.2.0)

No update needed!
```

Great! You're done. Come back in a few weeks.

**Option B: An update is available**
```
🎁 Lumi v1.3.0 is available

You're on: v1.2.0
Latest: v1.3.0

What's new:
- Career coach improvements
- Task deduplication fix
- Meeting intelligence enhancement

[View full release notes]
[Update now]
[Cancel]
```

**What this means:**
- Someone (probably me) made Lumi better
- Version 1.3.0 has new stuff
- You can get it by clicking [Update now]

**Your choices:**

1. **[Update now]** - Proceeds with the update (recommended)
2. **[View full release notes]** - Opens GitHub to see all details
3. **[Cancel]** - Exit without updating (you can run `/lumi-update` again later)

**Should you update?**

Usually yes! Updates make things better. But you can cancel if:
- You're in the middle of something urgent
- You want to read the full release notes first
- You want to wait and see if others have problems

**Note about "breaking changes":**

Sometimes you'll see: ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGES**

This means the update changes how something works in a big way. These are rare and come with extra instructions. Don't worry - the update process will guide you.

---

### Step 2: Confirm and Update

**If you clicked [Update now], here's what happens next:**

```
/lumi-update
```

**Press Enter.**

**What happens next:**

Lumi will walk you through the update. Here's what to expect:

---

#### A. Lumi Checks If You Have Git

**You'll see:**
```
✓ Git detected
```

**If you see this instead:**
```
❌ Git not detected

Lumi updates require Git. Here's how to install...
```

Don't panic! Follow the simple instructions. It's a one-time thing:

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. Type: `xcode-select --install`
3. Press Enter
4. Click "Install" when a window pops up
5. Wait 5 minutes for download
6. Come back to Cursor and try `/lumi-update` again

**On Windows:**
1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Click the download link
3. Run the installer (click Next on everything)
4. Restart Cursor
5. Try `/lumi-update` again

This only happens once. After this, updates are automatic.

---

#### B. Lumi Checks Your Setup

**You'll see:**
```
✓ Setup verified
```

If this is your first time updating, Lumi might configure a few things behind the scenes. This is normal and automatic.

**What's actually happening:**

Lumi is telling Git where to look for updates (on GitHub). Think of it like saving a bookmark in your browser.

---

#### C. Lumi Downloads the Updates

**You'll see:**
```
⬇️ Downloading updates from GitHub...
✓ Updates downloaded
```

**What's happening:**

Lumi is getting the new files from GitHub and bringing them to your computer.

**This requires internet.** If you see an error about network, check your WiFi and try again.

---

#### D. Lumi Protects Your Work

**You'll see:**
```
💾 Saving your work...
✓ Your work is saved
```

**What's happening:**

Before changing anything, Lumi saves a snapshot of how things are right now. It's like creating a restore point on your computer.

**Why this matters:**

If something goes wrong (very rare), you can undo the update instantly with `/lumi-rollback`.

This makes updating completely safe. You can always go back.

---

#### E. Lumi Applies the Updates

**You'll see:**
```
🔄 Applying updates...
```

**What's happening:**

Lumi is carefully updating its own files (the application) while leaving your files (your data) completely alone.

**Two possible outcomes:**

**Outcome 1: Clean update (most common)**
```
✓ Updates applied successfully
```

This means the update fit perfectly with your setup. No problems. This happens 95% of the time.

**Outcome 2: Overlapping changes (rare)**

Sometimes both you AND the main version changed the same file. For example:
- You customized a skill
- The update also changed that skill

**You'll see:**
```
🔍 Resolving overlapping changes...

Found changes in the same files:
- CLAUDE.md (your version vs update version)

Automatically keeping: Your customizations
Automatically updating: Core Lumi features

✓ Resolved automatically
```

**What Lumi does automatically:**

For each file with overlapping changes:

| File Type | What Lumi Keeps |
|-----------|----------------|
| Your notes, tasks, projects | **Your version (always)** |
| Your settings (user-profile, pillars) | **Your version (always)** |
| Core Lumi skills | **Update version (improvements)** |
| Core Lumi features | **Update version (improvements)** |
| Files you customized | **Your version (your changes)** |

**Translation:** Your stuff stays yours. Lumi improvements come through. Conflicts resolved automatically.

**You don't need to do anything.** Lumi handles this.

---

#### F. Lumi Updates Dependencies

**You'll see:**
```
📦 Updating dependencies...
✓ Dependencies updated
```

**What are dependencies?**

Think of Lumi like a car. The car (Lumi) needs certain parts to work: tires, battery, engine.

Dependencies are those parts. When Lumi updates, sometimes it needs newer parts.

**What's happening:**

Lumi is automatically installing or updating these parts. You don't need to do anything.

This takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on your internet.

---

#### G. Lumi Verifies Everything

**You'll see:**
```
✓ Update complete! Now testing...
✅ Update successful!
```

**What's happening:**

Lumi is checking that everything works:
- Can it find your tasks?
- Can it read your profile?
- Are all the features working?

If anything fails, Lumi will offer to undo the update automatically.

---

### Step 3: Confirmation

**You'll see a summary:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Lumi Updated: v1.2.0 → v1.3.0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's new:
• Career coach improvements
• Task deduplication fix
• Meeting intelligence enhancement

Your data:
✓ All notes preserved
✓ All tasks preserved
✓ All customizations preserved

Time taken: 2 minutes
```

**You're done!** The new features are ready to use.

---

### Step 4: Try It Out

**Test that everything works:**

1. Run your daily plan:
   ```
   /daily-plan
   ```

2. Open a person page:
   - Go to `05-Areas/People/` and open someone

3. Check your tasks:
   - Open `03-Tasks/Tasks.md`

Everything should work normally, plus you'll have the new features from the update.

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### The Instant Undo Button

**If anything feels wrong after updating, type:**

```
/lumi-rollback
```

**What happens:**

Lumi instantly restores everything to exactly how it was before you updated.

**How long it takes:** 30 seconds

**What gets restored:**
- ✓ Lumi features go back to old version
- ✓ All your notes, tasks, projects stay as they are

**Translation:** You tried the update, didn't like it, and now you're back to the old version. Your work is completely safe.

You can try updating again later, or just stay on the old version.

---

## Understanding How This Works (Optional)

*This section is for people who want to understand what's happening behind the scenes. You can skip this if you're happy just using the commands.*

### Why GitHub?

**Lumi is "open source"** - this means:
- Anyone can see how it works
- Anyone can improve it
- It's free forever
- You're not locked into a company

GitHub is where open source projects live. It's like a public workshop where improvements happen.

**Your copy of Lumi is completely yours.** It's on your computer, not on GitHub. But GitHub is where the "official" version lives, with all the latest improvements.

### What Git Actually Does

When you run `/lumi-update`, here's what Git does:

1. **Looks at GitHub** - "What's new since I last checked?"

2. **Downloads the changes** - "Let me grab those new features"

3. **Merges them into your copy** - "Let me carefully add these without touching your data"

**Why is this better than just re-downloading Lumi?**

If you re-downloaded Lumi, you'd have to:
- Delete your old version
- Download new version
- Copy all your files over manually
- Hope you didn't miss anything

Git does all this automatically in 2 minutes, without you lifting a finger.

### What "Version Control" Means

Git is a "version control" system. Think of it like Track Changes in Microsoft Word, but for an entire application.

Every time someone improves Lumi:
- Git records exactly what changed
- Git can show you the difference
- Git can combine improvements from multiple people
- Git can undo changes if something breaks

**For you, this means:**
- Updates are precise (only what changed gets updated)
- Your customizations are preserved (Git knows what you changed)
- Rollback is instant (Git remembers previous versions)

### The "Upstream" Concept

When you first downloaded Lumi, you downloaded it from GitHub. That GitHub location is called the "upstream" source.

Think of it like a river:
- **Upstream** = Where the water comes from (main Lumi on GitHub)
- **Your location** = Where you are (Lumi on your computer)

Updates flow downstream to you.

`/lumi-update` is just asking: "What's new upstream? Let me get it."

### Why Your Data Is Safe

Your data is in folders that Git **ignores**:
- `00-Inbox/`
- `03-Tasks/`
- `04-Projects/`
- `05-Areas/`
- All your notes and work

Git is told: "Never track these folders. Never change them. Never touch them."

It's in a file called `.gitignore` that explicitly lists everything to ignore.

So when updates come in, Git sees your data and thinks: "Not my job, skip these."

This is why updates can't hurt your data. Git literally doesn't see it.

---

## Automatic Update Checks

**You don't have to remember to check for updates.**

Every 7 days, during `/daily-plan`, Lumi automatically checks GitHub and tells you if an update is available:

```
🎁 Lumi v1.3.0 is available. Run /lumi-update to see what's new and update.

---

Here's your plan for today...
```

It's non-intrusive - just a heads up at the top of your daily plan.

**You decide when to update.** Lumi will never update itself without you asking. Running `/lumi-update` shows you what's new and asks for confirmation before proceeding.

**Want to disable these notifications?**

Edit `System/user-profile.yaml` and add:

```yaml
updates:
  auto_check: false
```

## FAQs for Non-Technical Users

### Do I need to update?

Not required, but recommended. Updates make things better:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements

Your current version will keep working fine. But you miss out on improvements.

**Good rule:** Update monthly, or when you see a feature you want.

---

### How often do updates come out?

Every few weeks to every few months, depending on what's being improved.

You'll know when they're available because of the automatic check during `/daily-plan`.

---

### Will I lose my work?

**No. Never. Impossible.**

Your work is in protected folders that updates don't touch. It's technically impossible for an update to delete your notes, tasks, or projects.

The worst that can happen: A new feature doesn't work right. But your data is always safe.

And if anything breaks, `/lumi-rollback` undoes the update in 30 seconds.

---

### What if my internet is slow?

The download step might take 3-5 minutes instead of 30 seconds. But it will complete.

The update process is patient - it won't time out.

---

### Can I skip an update?

Yes! If v1.3.0 comes out and you don't update, then v1.4.0 comes out, you can jump straight from v1.2.0 to v1.4.0.

Git handles this automatically.

---

### What are "breaking changes"?

Very rarely (maybe once a year), an update changes something in a big way. Examples:
- Renaming a major folder
- Changing how a feature works
- Updating the configuration format

These are marked with ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGES** in the release notes.

**What to do:**

The update process will guide you with extra steps (usually just running one extra command). It's still safe and still has rollback.

Breaking changes come with:
- Clear explanation of what's changing
- Why it's changing
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Extra safety checks

Don't avoid them - just read the notes carefully first.

---

### Can I see what will change before updating?

Yes! When you run:
```
/lumi-update
```

Lumi shows you the release notes and asks for confirmation before proceeding. You can:
- Read what's new
- View full release notes on GitHub
- Choose [Update now] or [Cancel]

You're never forced to update - you always confirm first.

---

### What if I made changes to Lumi itself?

**Customizations in recommended places:**
- `.claude/skills-custom/` - Your custom skills
- `core/mcp-custom/` - Your custom integrations
- `CLAUDE-custom.md` - Your prompt customizations

These are protected. Updates won't touch them.

**Changes to core Lumi files:**

If you edited a core file (like `.claude/skills/daily-plan/SKILL.md`), and an update also changes that file, Lumi will:
1. Detect the overlap
2. Ask which version to keep
   - If AskUserQuestion is available, Lumi shows a guided choice
   - If not, Lumi shows a CLI prompt with the same options + tradeoffs
3. Usually keep your version (your customizations)

But **better practice:** Put your customizations in the `-custom` folders so they never conflict.

---

### Can I undo an undo?

Yes! When you run `/lumi-rollback`, Lumi saves a snapshot before rolling back.

So if you rollback and then think "wait, I want the update back," you can restore it.

The rollback skill explains this.

---

### What if the update fails halfway through?

Lumi is careful about this. If something fails:

1. The update stops immediately
2. Lumi offers to restore to before the update
3. You're back to where you started (safe)
4. You can report the problem or try again later

**You're never left in a broken state.** Either the update completes successfully, or it rolls back automatically.

---

## Different Ways to Update (Summary)

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
```
/lumi-update
```
- Easiest
- Safest
- Handles everything
- **Use this method**

### Option 2: Manual (Advanced Users Only)

If you're comfortable with command-line tools and want to see exactly what's changing:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/dex
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Only use this if you understand Git. Everyone else should use `/lumi-update`.

### Option 3: Re-download (Last Resort)

If Git isn't working or you just want a fresh start:

1. Download latest Lumi from GitHub as a ZIP
2. Copy your data folders (00-07, System/) from old to new
3. Delete old Lumi folder
4. Rename new folder to 'dex'
5. Open in Cursor

This works but takes 10-15 minutes vs. 2 minutes for `/lumi-update`.

## Getting Help

### Something Broke and Rollback Didn't Fix It

1. **Don't panic** - Your data is safe (it's in separate folders)

2. **Report the issue:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/davekilleen/dex/issues
   - Click "New Issue"
   - Describe what happened and what you see

3. **Temporary workaround:**
   - Re-download Lumi
   - Copy your data folders back
   - Continue working while we fix the bug

### Questions About What Changed

- Read release notes: https://github.com/davekilleen/dex/releases
- Or run: `/lumi-update` (shows release notes before asking to proceed)

### Want to Learn More About Git

- GitHub's guide: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/
- Git for non-programmers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE

But remember: **You don't need to learn Git to use Lumi.** The `/lumi-update` command handles it all.

---

## Summary: The 2-Minute Update

**Update Lumi:**
```
/lumi-update
```
Shows what's new, you confirm, it updates.

**Undo if needed:**
```
/lumi-rollback
```
Instantly restores previous version.

**That's it.** Two commands. Your data is always safe. You can always undo.

Updates should improve your work, not create anxiety. If you're ever unsure, just ask in Cursor chat: "Should I update to v1.3.0?" and Lumi will explain what's new.

---

**Remember:** Lumi is yours. Update when you want, skip updates if you want, rollback if something feels off. You're in control.
